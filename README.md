# K-Means Clustering Analysis of Asthma Related Deaths and Fuel Type in the Bay Area

By Mihir Thakar

This Project is going to correlate Vehicle and Health data from 9 counties that make up the Bay Area. I obtained an "Asthma Deaths by County" and "Vehicle Fuel Type by Zip Code" dataset from the CA.gov open data portal. The most important task will involve organizing the zipcoded data into an organized data frame as each county is host to multiple zip codes. From there I will be able to connect whether the fuel type (Hybrid, Elec, Gas) has an affect on the presence of Asthma deaths and create a visualization based on most K-Means Clustering. The final results are then geocoded into chloropleth maps. You can follow my work pipeline below.
